In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!

A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day.
Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the ""Austrian School,"" which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.
Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt's focus on non-governmental solutions, strong -- and strongly reasoned -- anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uJ6cGAprL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg"

He describes how these two radically opposed views have manifested themselves in the political controversies of the past two centuries, including such contemporary issues as welfare reform, social justice, and crime. Updated to include sweeping political changes since its first publication in 1987, this revised edition of A Conflict of Visions offers a convincing case that ethical and policy disputes circle around the disparity between both outlooks.

51,The Authoritarian Moment: How the Left Weaponized America's Institutions Against Dissent,Ben Shapiro,63001829,978-0063001824,Law,"How far are Americans willing to go to force each other to fall in line? According to the establishment media, the intelligentsia, and our political chattering class, the greatest threat to American freedom lies in right-wing authoritarianism. We've heard that some 75 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump represent the rise of American fascism; that conservatives have allowed authoritarianism to bloom in their midst, creating a grave danger for the republic. But what if the true authoritarian threat to America doesn't come from the political right, but from the supposedly anti-fascist left? There are certainly totalitarians on the political Right. But statistically, they represent a fringe movement with little institutional clout. The authoritarian left, meanwhile, is ascendant in nearly every area of American life. A small number of leftists-college-educated, coastal, and uncompromising-have not just taken over the Democratic Party but our corporations, our universities, our scientific establishment, our cultural institutions. And they have used their newfound power to silence their opposition. The authoritarian Left is aggressively insistent that everyone must conform to its values, demanding submission and conformity. The dogmatic Left is obsessed with putting people in categories and changing human nature. Everyone who opposes it must be destroyed. Ben Shapiro looks at everything from pop culture to the Frankfurt school, social media to the Founding Fathers, to explain the origins of our turn to tyranny, and why so many seem blind to it. More than a catalog of bad actors and intemperate acts, The Authoritarian Moment lays bare the intolerance and rigidity creeping into all American ideology - and prescribes the solution to ending the authoritarianism that threatens our future.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Axwjh22KS._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg"

Their sources were in the room as time and time again Trump put his personal gain ahead of the good of the country. These witnesses to history tell the story of him longing to deploy the military to the streets of American cities to crush the protest movement in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, all to bolster his image of strength ahead of the election. These sources saw firsthand his refusal to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously—even to the point of allowing himself and those around him to be infected. This is a story of a nation sabotaged—economically, medically, and politically—by its own leader, culminating with a groundbreaking, minute-by-minute account of exactly what went on in the Capitol building on January 6, as Trump’s supporters so easily breached the most sacred halls of American democracy, and how the president reacted. With unparalleled access, Rucker and Leonnig explain and expose exactly who enabled—and who foiled—Trump as he sought desperately to cling to power.

68,Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events,Robert J. Shiller,691210268,978-0691210261,Economics,"From Nobel Prize–winning economist and New York Times bestselling author Robert Shiller, a groundbreaking account of how stories help drive economic events—and why financial panics can spread like epidemic viruses

Stories people tell—about financial confidence or panic, housing booms, or Bitcoin—can go viral and powerfully affect economies, but such narratives have traditionally been ignored in economics and finance because they seem anecdotal and unscientific. In this groundbreaking book, Robert Shiller explains why we ignore these stories at our peril—and how we can begin to take them seriously. Using a rich array of examples and data, Shiller argues that studying popular stories that influence individual and collective economic behavior—what he calls ""narrative economics""—may vastly improve our ability to predict, prepare for, and lessen the damage of financial crises and other major economic events. The result is nothing less than a new way to think about the economy, economic change, and economics. In a new preface, Shiller reflects on some of the challenges facing narrative economics, discusses the connection between disease epidemics and economic epidemics, and suggests why epidemiology may hold lessons for fighting economic contagions.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MlY5Ak1aL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Why some employers and employees were arguing over workers being re-hired during the first COVID-19 lockdown? Why passenger airlines were able to get their own ring-fenced bailout from Congress? Economics in One Virus answers all these pandemic-related questions and many more, drawing on the dramatic events of 2020 to bring to life some of the most important principles of economic thought. Packed with supporting data and the best new academic evidence, this book offers a crash-course in economics analysis through the applied case-study of the COVID-19 pandemic, to help explain everything from why the U.S. was underprepared for the pandemic to how economists go about valuing the lives saved from lockdowns.After completing this highly readable, fast-paced, and provocative virus-themed economic tour, readers will be able to make much better sense of the events that they've lived through.

70,Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies,Nik Bhatia,1736110527,978-1736110522,Economics,"In this fascinating deep dive into the evolution of monetary systems around the globe, Nik Bhatia takes us into the origins of how money has evolved to function in a ""layered"" manner. Using gold as an example of this term, he traces the layers of this ancient currency from raw mined material, to gold coins, and finally to bank-issued gold certificates. In a groundbreaking manner, Bhatia offers a similar paradigm for the evolution of digital currencies. Bhatia's analysis begins in Renaissance Florence with the gold Florin coin and a burgeoning banking culture, continues with the evolution of central banking, and concludes with a vision for the future of our international monetary system. As central banks around the world prepare to launch their own crypto-competitors, Bhatia illustrates how the invention of Bitcoin created a seismic shift in money and merged the monetary and cryptography sciences. His unique analysis of ""layered money"" illuminates money markets for the general reader and shows how Bitcoin is becoming a trusted global currency. Readers will come away with an understanding of the mechanics of our financial system, why the dollar is deeply entrenched despite its state of disrepair, and how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies will interact in our new monetary future.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nx2W0cQML._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

It dominates our decision-making for the future, guides multi-billion-dollar investments, and shapes our responses to climate change, inequality, and other environmental and social challenges that define our times. Pity then, or more like disaster, that its fundamental ideas are centuries out of date yet are still taught in college courses worldwide and still used to address critical issues in government and business alike. That's why it is time, says renegade economist Kate Raworth, to revise our economic thinking for the 21st century. In Doughnut Economics, she sets out seven key ways to fundamentally reframe our understanding of what economics is and does. Along the way, she points out how we can break our addiction to growth; redesign money, finance, and business to be in service to people; and create economies that are regenerative and distributive by design. Named after the now-iconic ""doughnut"" image that Raworth first drew to depict a sweet spot of human prosperity (an image that appealed to the Occupy Movement, the United Nations, eco-activists, and business leaders alike), Doughnut Economics offers a radically new compass for guiding global development, government policy, and corporate strategy, and sets new standards for what economic success looks like. Raworth handpicks the best emergent ideas--from ecological, behavioral, feminist, and institutional economics to complexity thinking and Earth-systems science--to address this question: How can we turn economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive, into economies that make us thrive, whether or not they grow? Simple, playful, and eloquent, Doughnut Economics offers game-changing analysis and inspiration for a new generation of economic thinkers.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O2MPGym9L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal. He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions--suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise. As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zodnhPKXS._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
74,The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future ,Gretchen Bakke,1632865688,978-1632865687,Engineering,"A revelatory look at our national power grid--how it developed, its current flaws, and how it must be completely reimagined for our fast-approaching energy future. America's electrical grid, an engineering triumph of the twentieth century, is turning out to be a poor fit for the present. It's not just that the grid has grown old and is now in dire need of basic repair. Today, as we invest great hope in new energy sources--solar, wind, and other alternatives--the grid is what stands most firmly in the way of a brighter energy future. If we hope to realize this future, we need to reimagine the grid according to twenty-first-century values. It's a project which forces visionaries to work with bureaucrats, legislators with storm-flattened communities, moneymen with hippies, and the left with the right. And though it might not yet be obvious, this revolution is already well under way. Cultural anthropologist Gretchen Bakke unveils the many facets of America's energy infrastructure, its most dynamic moments and its most stable ones, and its essential role in personal and national life. The grid, she argues, is an essentially American artifact, one which developed with us: a product of bold expansion, the occasional foolhardy vision, some genius technologies, and constant improvisation. Most of all, her focus is on how Americans are changing the grid right now, sometimes with gumption and big dreams and sometimes with legislation or the brandishing of guns. The Grid tells--entertainingly, perceptively--the story of what has been called ""the largest machine in the world"": its fascinating history, its problematic present, and its potential role in a brighter, cleaner future.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eNlPsVFUS._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

The case drew Bryan into a tangle of conspiracy, political machination, and legal brinksmanship--and transformed his understanding of mercy and justice forever.

Exploding the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice or the unintended consequences of economic forces, Rothstein describes how the American government systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial zoning; public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities; subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs; tax exemptions for institutions that enforced segregation; and support for violent resistance to African Americans in white neighborhoods.

But the Secret Service wasn't always so troubled. The Secret Service was born in 1865, in the wake of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but its story begins in earnest in 1963, with the death of John F. Kennedy. Shocked into reform by its failure to protect the president on that fateful day in Dallas, this once-sleepy agency was radically transformed into an elite, highly trained unit that would redeem itself several times, most famously in 1981 by thwarting an assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan. But this reputation for courage and excellence would not last forever. By Barack Obama's presidency, the once-proud Secret Service was running on fumes and beset by mistakes and alarming lapses in judgment: break-ins at the White House, an armed gunman firing into the windows of the residence while confused agents stood by, and a massive prostitution scandal among agents in Cartagena, to name just a few. With Donald Trump's arrival, a series of promised reforms were cast aside, as a president disdainful of public service instead abused the Secret Service to rack up political and personal gains. To explore these problems in the ranks, Leonnig interviewed dozens of current and former agents, government officials, and whistleblowers who put their jobs on the line to speak out about a hobbled agency that's in desperate need of reform. ""I will be forever grateful to them for risking their careers,"" she writes, ""not because they wanted to share tantalizing gossip about presidents and their families, but because they know that the Service is broken and needs fixing. By telling their story, they hope to revive the Service they love.""","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dAXIOxCKL._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Since the publication of the first edition of Critical Race Theory in 2001, the United States has lived through two economic downturns, an outbreak of terrorism, and the onset of an epidemic of hate directed against immigrants, especially undocumented Latinos and Middle Eastern people. On a more hopeful note, the country elected and re-elected its first black president and has witnessed the impressive advance of gay rights. As a field, critical race theory has taken note of all these developments, and this primer does so as well. It not only covers a range of emerging new topics and events, it also addresses the rise of a fierce wave of criticism from right-wing websites, think tanks, and foundations, some of which insist that America is now colorblind and has little use for racial analysis and study. Critical Race Theory is essential for understanding developments in this burgeoning field, which has spread to other disciplines and countries. The new edition also covers the ways in which other societies and disciplines adapt its teachings and, for readers wanting to advance a progressive race agenda, includes new questions for discussion, aimed at outlining practical steps to achieve this objective.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414TizogpSL._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why its absence is so damaging to our health. Compared to the other basic drives in life - eating, drinking, and reproducing - the purpose of sleep remained elusive.

Now, in this book, the first of its kind written by a scientific expert, Professor Matthew Walker explores twenty years of cutting-edge research to solve the mystery of why sleep matters. Looking at creatures from across the animal kingdom as well as major human studies, Why We Sleep delves in to everything from what really happens during REM sleep to how caffeine and alcohol affect sleep and why our sleep patterns change across a lifetime, transforming our appreciation of the extraordinary phenomenon that safeguards our existence.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yN1NYjE8L._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

In How I Saved the World, Jesse Watters takes readers on a tour of his life from basement-dwelling Fox minion to pampered champion of right-thinking Americans. He has divined great truths about the nature of our country while stumbling across beaches asking oblivious college students basic political questions and while stumbling out of Air Force One with the President. Interspersed are his thoughtful suggestions for overcoming left-wing radicalism, maintaining American democracy, moving beyond aging hippies (like his long-suffering, loving parents), saving the world from social justice warriors and the deep state--all while smirking his way through life in only the nicest way. Watters outlines the stark choice ahead of us between all-American hamburgers and leftist Green New Deal breadlines (okay, maybe that one is a no-brainer) and shows the way for order and fairness to be restored.

 A Best Book of the Year: The Financial Times, Bloomberg, Chicago Tribune, and Detroit Free Press

 How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to one another that isn’t true?
 
Talking to Strangers is a classically Gladwellian intellectual adventure, a challenging and controversial excursion through history, psychology, and scandals taken straight from the news. He revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland—throwing our understanding of these and other stories into doubt.
 
Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don’t know. And because we don’t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. In his first book since his #1 bestseller David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.

'The Storm Is Upon Us is an impressive piece of research and a gripping read. Rothschild's book reads like a thriller, with cliffhangers that leave you eager for the next episode. The trouble, of course, is that it's not fiction.' - The Times
'An ideal tour guide for your journey into the depths of the rabbit hole that is QAnon, and even shows you a glimmer of light at the exit.' - Cullen Hoback, director of HBO's Q: Into the Storm
In 2017, President Trump made a cryptic remark at a gathering of military officials, describing it as 'the calm before the storm'-then refused to explain himself to puzzled journalists. But on internet message boards, a mysterious poster called 'Q Clearance Patriot' began an elaboration all of their own.
Q's wild yarn hinted at a vast conspiracy that satisfied the deepest desires of MAGA-America. None of Q's predictions came to pass. But did that stop people from clinging to every word, expanding Q's mythology, and promoting it ever more widely? No.
Conspiracy culture expert Mike Rothschild is uniquely equipped to explain QAnon, from the cults that first fed into it, to its embrace by Trump and the right-wing media. With families torn apart and with the Capitol under attack, he argues that mocking the madness of QAnon will get us nowhere.

98,Introduction to Statistics: An Intuitive Guide for Analyzing Data and Unlocking Discoveries,Jim Frost,1735431109,978-1735431109,Statistics,"Learn statistics without fear! Build a solid foundation in data analysis. Be confident that you understand what your data are telling you and that you can explain the results to others! I'll help you intuitively understand statistics by using simple language and deemphasizing formulas.

This guide starts with an overview of statistics and why it is so important. We proceed to essential statistical skills and knowledge about different types of data, relationships, and distributions. Then we move to using inferential statistics to expand human knowledge, how it fits into the scientific method, and how to design and critique experiments.

Learn the fundamentals of statistics:

Why is the field of statistics so vital in our data-driven society?
Interpret graphs and summary statistics.
Find relationships between different types of variables.
Understand the properties of data distributions.
Use measures of central tendency and variability.
Interpret correlations and percentiles.
Use probability distributions to calculate probabilities.
Learn about the normal and binomial distributions in depth.
Grasp the differences between descriptive and inferential statistics.
Use data collection methodologies properly and understand sample size considerations.

99,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data 1st Edition,Charles Wheelan ,039334777X,978-0393347777,Statistics,"Once considered tedious, the field of statistics is rapidly evolving into a discipline Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, has actually called “sexy.” From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more.
For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.

And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show Let’s Make a Deal—and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned Naked Economics into a bestseller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411b2L+7v3L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

101,Large Deviations and Idempotent Probability (CRC Monographs and Surveys in Pure and Applied Math (Hardcover)),Anatolii Puhalskii,367455293,978-0367455293,Mathematics,"In the view of many probabilists, author Anatolii Puhalskii's research results stand among the most significant achievements in the modern theory of large deviations. In fact, his work marked a turning point in the depth of our understanding of the connections between the large deviation principle (LDP) and well-known methods for establishing weak convergence results.

Large Deviations and Idempotent Probability expounds upon the recent methodology of building large deviation theory along the lines of weak convergence theory. The author develops an idempotent (or maxitive) probability theory, introduces idempotent analogues of martingales (maxingales), Wiener and Poisson processes, and Ito differential equations, and studies their properties. The large deviation principle for stochastic processes is formulated as a certain type of convergence of stochastic processes to idempotent processes. The author calls this large deviation convergence.

The approach to establishing large deviation convergence uses novel compactness arguments. Coupled with the power of stochastic calculus, this leads to very general results on large deviation asymptotics of semimartingales. Large and moderate deviation asymptotics are treated in a unified manner. 

Starting with the foundations of idempotent measure theory and culminating in applications to large deviation asymptotics of queueing systems, Large Deviations and Idempotent Probability offers an outstanding opportunity to examine both the development of a remarkable approach and recently discovered results as presented by one of the foremost leaders in the field.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vr2SxciIL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

You'll never find a wiser advisor with a bigger heart."" -- Malachi Rempen: Filmmaker, cartoonist, author and self-described ruffian

This book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things-mostly about money and investing-she was not yet quite ready to hear.

Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we've created, understanding it is critical.

""But Dad,"" she once said, ""I know money is important. I just don't want to spend my life thinking about it."" This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run.

Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms.

Here's an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective.

The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other.

Together we'll explore:
*Debt: Why you must avoid it and what to do if you have it.
*The importance of having F-you Money.
*How to think about money, and the unique way understanding this is key to building your wealth.
*Where traditional investing advice goes wrong and what actually works.
*What the stock market really is and how it really works.
*Why the stock market always goes up and why most people still lose money investing in it.
*How to invest in a raging bull, or bear, market.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oX+Lk2-ML._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Many people call themselves hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope.

Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker's perspective.

The included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and debugging environment—all without modifying your current operating system. Use it to follow along with the book's examples as you fill gaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own. Get your hands dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking network communications, bypassing protections, exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits. This book will teach you how to:
– Program computers using C, assembly language, and shell scripts
– Corrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer overflows and format strings
– Inspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger to gain a real understanding of what is happening
– Outsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and intrusion detection systems
– Gain access to a remote server using port-binding or connect-back shellcode, and alter a server's logging behavior to hide your presence
– Redirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP connections
– Crack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and speed up brute-force attacks using a password probability matrix

Hackers are always pushing the boundaries, investigating the unknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don't already know how to program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give you a complete picture of programming, machine architecture, network communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine this knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you need is your own creativity.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VBaAS4IbL._SX383_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

“A powerful read that fills one with, dare I say . . . hope?”—The New York Times 
  
NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE

There is a renaissance blooming in the climate movement: leadership that is more characteristically feminine and more faithfully feminist, rooted in compassion, connection, creativity, and collaboration. While it’s clear that women and girls are vital voices and agents of change for this planet, they are too often missing from the proverbial table. More than a problem of bias, it’s a dynamic that sets us up for failure. To change everything, we need everyone. 
  
All We Can Save illuminates the expertise and insights of dozens of diverse women leading on climate in the United States—scientists, journalists, farmers, lawyers, teachers, activists, innovators, wonks, and designers, across generations, geographies, and race—and aims to advance a more representative, nuanced, and solution-oriented public conversation on the climate crisis. These women offer a spectrum of ideas and insights for how we can rapidly, radically reshape society. 
  
Intermixing essays with poetry and art, this book is both a balm and a guide for knowing and holding what has been done to the world, while bolstering our resolve never to give up on one another or our collective future. We must summon truth, courage, and solutions to turn away from the brink and toward life-giving possibility. Curated by two climate leaders, the book is a collection and celebration of visionaries who are leading us on a path toward all we can save.

We live in an extraordinary time. Technological advances are happening at a rate faster than our ability to understand them, and in a world that moves faster than we can imagine, we cannot afford to stand still. These advances bring efficiency and abundance—and they are profoundly deflationary.

Our economic systems were built for a pre-technology era when labour and capital were inextricably linked, an era that counted on growth and inflation, an era where we made money from inefficiency. That era is over, but we keep on pretending that those economic systems still work.

The only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend—and with it, debt that we will never be able to pay back. As we try to artificially drive an economic system built for the past, we are creating more than just economic trouble.

On our current path, our world will become profoundly more polarized and unsafe. We need to build a new framework for our local and global economies, and soon; we need to accept deflation and embrace the abundance it can bring. Otherwise, the same technology that has the power to bring abundance to us and our world will instead destroy it.

In this extraordinary contrarian book, Jeff Booth, a leading mind and CEO in e-commerce and technology for 20 years, details the technological and economic realities shaping our present and our future, and the choices we face as we go forward—a potentially alarming, but deeply hopeful situation.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41C7TkN5KeL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
138,Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,"Edward S. Herman, Noam Chomsky",375714499,978-0375714498,Economics,"In this pathbreaking work, now with a new introduction, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky show that, contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order.
Based on a series of case studies--including the media's dichotomous treatment of ""worthy"" versus ""unworthy"" victims, ""legitimizing"" and ""meaningless"" Third World elections, and devastating critiques of media coverage of the U.S. wars against Indochina--Herman and Chomsky draw on decades of criticism and research to propose a Propaganda Model to explain the media's behavior and performance. Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications. These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media's handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media's treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514vU-m6ulL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

146,RF Power Semiconductor Generator Application in Heating and Energy Utilization,"Satoshi Horikoshi (Editor), Nick Serpone (Editor)",9811535507,978-9811535505,Engineering,"This is a specialized book for researchers and technicians of universities and companies who are interested in the fundamentals of RF power semiconductors, their applications and market penetration. Looking around, we see that products using vacuum tube technology are disappearing. For example, branch tube TVs have changed to liquid crystal TVs, and fluorescent light have turned into LED. The switch from vacuum tube technology to semiconductor technology has progressed remarkably. At the same time, high-precision functionalization, miniaturization and energy saving have advanced. On the other hand, there is a magnetron which is a vacuum tube device for generating microwaves. However, even this vacuum tube technology has come to be replaced by RF power semiconductor technology. In the last few years the price of semiconductors has dropped sharply and its application to microwave heating and energy fields will proceed. In some fields the transition from magnetron microwave oscillator to semiconductor microwave oscillator has already begun. From now on this development will progress remarkably. Although there are several technical books on electrical systems that explain RF power semiconductors, there are no books yet based on users' viewpoints on actual microwave heating and energy fields. In particular, none have been written about exact usage and practical cases, to answer questions such as ""What are the advantages and disadvantages of RF power semiconductor oscillator?"", ""What kind of field can be used?"" and the difficulty of the market and application. Based on these issues, this book explains the RF power semiconductors from the user's point of view by covering a very wide range of fields.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ofdvyrlUL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

The book gives novices a platform from which they can start exploring the subject in more detail.

After introducing concepts related to elasticity, acoustics, and electrodynamics in media, the text presents plane wave solutions to the equations that describe elastic, acoustic, and electromagnetic waves. It examines the plane wave expansion of sources as well as scattering from curved interfaces, specifically spheres and cylinders. The author then covers electrodynamic, acoustic, and elastodynamic metamaterials. He also describes examples of transformations, aspects of acoustic cloaking, and applications of pentamode materials to acoustic cloaking. With a focus on periodic composites, the text uses the Bloch-Floquet theorem to find the effective behavior of composites in the quasistatic limit, presents the quasistatic equations of elastodynamic and electromagnetic waves, and investigates Brillouin zones and band gaps in periodic structures. The final chapter discusses wave propagation in smoothly varying layered media, anisotropic density of a periodic layered medium, and quasistatic homogenization of laminates.

This book provides a launch pad for research into elastic and acoustic metamaterials. Many of the ideas presented have yet to be realized experimentally-the book encourages readers to explore these ideas and bring them to technological maturity.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GNBZFIlML._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Developed countries have a huge expenditure for annual as well long term care of this condition. This abnormal leg condition has various types of presentation, sometimes-vague symptomatology. Identifying these symptoms and arriving at confirmed diagnosis is the first step to relieve this worldwide disease. Traditionally, management of varicose veins has been surgical, which at best provides temporary relief, sometimes-residual disease, and often recurs. However, with the introduction of newer interventional techniques, scenario of varicose veins management has entirely changed in past few years. The endovenous procedures, as they are commonly labeled, have not only improved the morbidity related to this disease, but also achieved higher technical success rate. Widely prevalent amongst such techniques has been the Endovenous Laser treatment. This procedure is performed all across the globe in a variety of fashion, which basically comes down to same underlying mechanism of action. In proper skilled hands though, the results may vary. However, anyone intending to perform this procedure may initially have innumerable questions pertaining to this disease and treatment techniques, some of which could be trivial and others critical. With the aim that the beginners, health care practitioners, physicians, referring consultants, undergraduate and postgraduate medical students of various specialties and subspecialties understand this procedure easily and hopefully thoroughly, we have taken this step to write our experience. One critical component of this as well as other endovenous procedures though is ultrasound guidance, and hence knowledge of vascular ultrasound, particularly venous exam is a kind of unspoken requirement. We have tried to include the relevant information that one may find useful during the learning curve phase of the procedure, and also serve as a valuable tool to refer to, anytime later during the practice. The book includes lower limb venous anatomy, pathophysiology of chronic venous insufficiency, clinical presentation and diagnoses of varicose veins. The detailed step in management of this condition by endovenous laser and sclerotherapy has then been explained, which includes the post procedure expectations.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Xrnb0jy6L._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

174,"Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties","Tom O'Neill, Dan Piepenbring",316477540,978-0316477543,Politics & Social Science,"A journalist's twenty-year fascination with the Manson murders leads to shocking new revelations about the FBI's involvement in this riveting reassessment of an infamous case in American history. Over two grim nights in Los Angeles, the young followers of Charles Manson murdered seven people, including the actress Sharon Tate, then eight months pregnant. With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader's every order-their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the sixties. Manson became one of history's most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia-or dystopia-was just an acid trip away. Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the ""official"" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi-prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of Helter Skelter -turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions: Who were Manson's real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties? Why didn't law enforcement, including Manson's own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him? And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers? O'Neill's quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco's summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA's mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders. This is a book that overturns our understanding of a pivotal time in American history.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41sxBN-jQLL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

—Dr. David Jeremiah

“Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed,
for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9).

Each day, you watch America turn further from Christian values and the core principles of liberty. It’s frustrating to feel you can’t assert biblical truth without facing condemnation, and fearful to witness outrage and victimhood replace respect and reason. Amidst this dissent, how can you not only stay rooted in your own faith, but continue publicly testifying for Jesus?

In We Will Not Be Silenced, Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer prepares you to live out your convictions against a growing tide of hostility. Gain a better understanding of nonbelievers’ legitimate hurts and concerns regarding issues like racism, sexism, and poverty—and identify the toxic responses secular culture disguises as solutions. In the process, you’ll see how you can show compassion and gentleness to those outside of the faith without affirming their beliefs.

We Will Not Be Silenced will ready you to move beyond fear and boldly accept the challenge of representing Christ to a watching world that needs Him now more than ever before","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H18d6WaYL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Do you really want the crooked baby-kissers and fake news to tell you what your rights are?

Wouldn’t you rather discover them for yourself?

The Founders fought tirelessly to guarantee these God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

But let’s face it—the Bill of Rights is hard to understand.

Its text is flowery and puzzling.

And without the right historical background, it’s impossible to grasp the full meaning, importance, and scope of each of the amendments (and especially the second amendment).

This book is the shortcut.
With it, you’ll quickly reach a deep understanding of the Bill of Rights thanks to the precise definitions of key words, crucial historical contexts, and enlightening insights from the Founders and their peers.

So, if you’re . . .

Fanon’s masterwork is a classic alongside Edward Said’s Orientalism or The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and it is now available in a new translation that updates its language for a new generation of readers. The Wretched of the Earth is a brilliant analysis of the psychology of the colonized and their path to liberation. Bearing singular insight into the rage and frustration of colonized peoples, and the role of violence in effecting historical change, the book incisively attacks the twin perils of postindependence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the elites on the one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other. Fanon’s analysis, a veritable handbook of social reorganization for leaders of emerging nations, has been reflected all too clearly in the corruption and violence that has plagued present-day Africa. The Wretched of the Earth has had a major impact on civil rights, anticolonialism, and black consciousness movements around the world, and this bold new translation by Richard Philcox reaffirms it as a landmark.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kV+wGTF9L._SX337_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Originally published in 1944--when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program--""The Road to Serfdom"" was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.
First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, ""The Road to Serfdom"" garnered immediate, widespread attention. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 books were sold. In April 1945, ""Reader's Digest"" published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this edition to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best seller, the book has sold 400,000 copies in the United States alone and has been translated into more than twenty languages, along the way becoming one of the most important and influential books of the century.
With this new edition, ""The Road to Serfdom"" takes its place in the series ""The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek."" The volume includes a foreword by series editor and leading Hayek scholar Bruce Caldwell explaining the book's origins and publishing history and assessing common misinterpretations of Hayek's thought. Caldwell has also standardized and corrected Hayek's references and added helpful new explanatory notes. Supplemented with an appendix of related materials ranging from prepublication reports on the initial manuscript to forewords to earlier editions by John Chamberlain, Milton Friedman, and Hayek himself, this new edition of ""The Road to Serfdom"" will be the definitive version of Friedrich Hayek's enduring masterwork.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413qkKEwKQL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
180,Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help YouFind,"Amir Levine, Rachel Heller",1585429139,978-1585429134,Politics & Social Science,"""A groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be in a relationship.""
--John Gray, PhD., bestselling author of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus


We already rely on science to tell us what to eat, when to exercise, and how long to sleep. Why not use science to help us improve our relationships? In this revolutionary book, psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller scientifically explain why why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle.

Discover how an understanding of adult attachment—the most advanced relationship science in existence today—can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways:

   • Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back
   • Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness.
   • Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.
 
Attached guides readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41IHZDi95aS._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
181,White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,"Robin DiAngelo, Michael Eric Dyson (Foreword by)",807047414,978-0807047415,Politics & Social Science,"The New York Times best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality.

In this “vital, necessary, and beautiful book” (Michael Eric Dyson), antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo deftly illuminates the phenomenon of white fragility and “allows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to ‘bad people’ (Claudia Rankine). Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O1xkNu14L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE FROM HBO® STARRING OPRAH WINFREY AND ROSE BYRNE • ONE OF THE “MOST INFLUENTIAL” (CNN), “DEFINING” (LITHUB), AND “BEST” (THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER) BOOKS OF THE DECADE • ONE OF ESSENCE’S 50 MOST IMPACTFUL BLACK BOOKS OF THE PAST 50 YEARS • WINNER OF THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE HEARTLAND PRIZE FOR NONFICTION

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • Entertainment Weekly • O: The Oprah Magazine • NPR • Financial Times • New York • Independent (U.K.) • Times (U.K.) • Publishers Weekly • Library Journal • Kirkus Reviews • Booklist • Globe and Mail

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. 

Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. 

Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? 

Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51t8jkeallL._SX282_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
184,The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship: A Toltec Wisdom Book,"Don Miguel Ruiz, Janet Mills",1878424424,978-1878424426,Politics & Social Science,"In The Mastery of Love, don Miguel Ruiz illuminates the fear-based beliefs and assumptions that undermine love and lead to suffering and drama in our relationships. Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, Ruiz shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships.

The Mastery of Love includes:
• Why ""domestication"" and the ""image of perfection"" lead to self-rejection
• The war of control that slowly destroys most relationships
• Why we hunt for love in others, and how to capture the love inside us
• How to finally accept and forgive ourselves and others

""Happiness can only come from inside of you and is the result of your love. When you are aware that no one else can make you happy, and that happiness is the result of your love, this becomes the greatest mastery of the Toltec: the Mastery of Love."" — don Miguel Ruiz","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gxY+U7dML._SX343_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
185,Black Rednecks and White Liberals,Thomas Sowell,1594031436,978-1594031434,Politics & Social Science,"This explosive new book challenges many of the long-prevailing assumptions about blacks, about Jews, about Germans, about slavery, and about education. Plainly written, powerfully reasoned, and backed with a startling array of documented facts, Black Rednecks and White Liberals takes on not only the trendy intellectuals of our times but also such historic interpreters of American life as Alexis de Tocqueville and Frederick Law Olmsted. In a series of long essays, this book presents an in-depth look at key beliefs behind many mistaken and dangerous actions, policies, and trends. It presents eye-opening insights into the historical development of the ghetto culture that is today wrongly seen as a unique black identity--a culture cheered on toward self-destruction by white liberals who consider themselves ""friends"" of blacks. An essay titled ""The Real History of Slavery"" presents a jolting re-examination of that tragic institution and the narrow and distorted way it is too often seen today. The reasons for the venomous hatred of Jews, and of other groups like them in countries around the world, are explored in an essay that asks, ""Are Jews Generic?"" Misconceptions of German history in general, and of the Nazi era in particular, are also re-examined. So too are the inspiring achievements and painful tragedies of black education in the United States. ""Black Rednecks and White Liberals"" is the capstone of decades of outstanding research and writing on racial and cultural issues by Thomas Sowell.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EM+u5bgML._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who want to learn probability and statistics quickly. It is suitable for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines. 

The book includes modern topics like non-parametric curve estimation, bootstrapping, and classification, topics that are usually relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is presumed to know calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of probability and statistics is required. Statistics, data mining, and machine learning are all concerned with collecting and analysing data. ","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uzRsU-CaL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

The author, David A. Freedman, explains the basic ideas of association and regression, and takes you through the current models that link these ideas to causality. The focus is on applications of linear models, including generalized least squares and two-stage least squares, with probits and logits for binary variables. The bootstrap is developed as a technique for estimating bias and computing standard errors. Careful attention is paid to the principles of statistical inference. There is background material on study design, bivariate regression, and matrix algebra. To develop technique, there are computer labs with sample computer programs. The book is rich in exercises, most with answers. Target audiences include advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in statistics, as well as students and professionals in the social and health sciences. The discussion in the book is organized around published studies, as are many of the exercises. Relevant journal articles are reprinted at the back of the book. Freedman makes a thorough appraisal of the statistical methods in these papers and in a variety of other examples. He illustrates the principles of modeling, and the pitfalls. The discussion shows you how to think about the critical issues - including the connection (or lack of it) between the statistical models and the real phenomena. Features of the book: • authoritative guidance from a well-known author with wide experience in teaching, research, and consulting • careful analysis of statistical issues in substantive applications • no-nonsense, direct style • versatile structure, enabling the text to be used as a text in a course, or read on its own • text that has been thoroughly class-tested at Berkeley • background material on regression and matrix algebra • plenty of exercises, most with solutions • extra material for instructors, including data sets and code for lab projects (available from Cambridge University Press) • many new exercises and examples • reorganized, restructured, and revised chapters to aid teaching and understanding","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wSCeXvDDL._SX346_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Feynman (1918-1988) — physicist, teacher, author, and cultural icon. His autobiographies and biographies have been read and enjoyed by millions of readers around the world, while his wit and eccentricities have made him the subject of TV specials and even a theatrical film. The spectacular reception of the book and audio versions of Feynman's Six Easy Pieces (published in 1995) resulted in a worldwide clamor for ""More Feynman! More Feynman!"" The outcome is these six additional lectures, drawn from the celebrated three-volume Lectures on Physics. Though slightly more challenging than the first six, these lectures are more focused, delving into the most revolutionary discovery in twentieth-century physics: Einstein's Theory of Relativity. No single breakthrough in twentieth-century physics (with the possible exception of quantum mechanics) changed our view of the world more than that of Einstein's discovery of relativity. The notions that the flow of time is not a constant, that the mass of an object depends on its velocity, and that the speed of light is a constant no matter what the motion of the observer, at first seemed shocking to scientists and laymen alike. But, as Feynman shows so clearly and so entertainingly in the lectures chosen for this volume, these crazy notions are no mere dry principles of physics, but are things of beauty and elegance. No one — not even Einstein himself — explained these difficult, anti-intuitive concepts more clearly, or with more verve and gusto, than Richard Feynman.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v2WDVhFjL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

It was Richard Feynman's outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961 to 1963, Feynman delivered a series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from these famous Lectures on Physics, represent the most accessible material from the series.

In these classic lessons, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, energy, gravitation, quantum mechanics, and the relationship of physics to other topics. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion with a minimum of jargon. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible physicists of modern times.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KR3BGtzsL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can’t maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago.
 
As dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HB+5JVISL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
222,"Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership (Justice, Power, and Politics)",Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor,1469663880,978-1469663883,Economics,"LONGLISTED FOR THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARDFINALIST, 2020 PULITZER PRIZE IN HISTORYBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, reeling from a wave of urban uprisings, politicians finally worked to end the practice of redlining. Reasoning that the turbulence could be calmed by turning Black city-dwellers into homeowners, they passed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and set about establishing policies to induce mortgage lenders and the real estate industry to treat Black homebuyers equally. The disaster that ensued revealed that racist exclusion had not been eradicated, but rather transmuted into a new phenomenon of predatory inclusion . Race for Profit uncovers how exploitative real estate practices continued well after housing discrimination was banned. The same racist structures and individuals remained intact after redlining's end, and close relationships between regulators and the industry created incentives to ignore improprieties. Meanwhile, new policies meant to encourage low-income homeownership created new methods to exploit Black homeowners. The federal government guaranteed urban mortgages in an attempt to overcome resistance to lending to Black buyers - as if unprofitability, rather than racism, was the cause of housing segregation. Bankers, investors, and real estate agents took advantage of the perverse incentives, targeting the Black women most likely to fail to keep up their home payments and slip into foreclosure, multiplying their profits. As a result, by the end of the 1970s, the nation's first programs to encourage Black homeownership ended with tens of thousands of foreclosures in Black communities across the country. The push to uplift Black homeownership had descended into a goldmine for realtors and mortgage lenders, and a ready-made cudgel for the champions of deregulation to wield against government intervention of any kind.Narrating the story of a sea-change in housing policy and its dire impact on African Americans, Race for Profit reveals how the urban core was transformed into a new frontier of cynical extraction.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41iaG7G0TzL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
223,"The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It",Robert B. Reich,593082001,978-0593082003,Economics,"From the bestselling author of Saving Capitalism and The Common Good, comes an urgent analysis of how the ""rigged"" systems of American politics and power operate, how this status quo came to be, and how average citizens can enact change.

There is a mounting sense that our political-economic system is no longer working, but what is the core problem and how do we remedy it? With the characteristic clarity and passion that have made him a central civil voice, bestselling author of Saving Capitalism and The Common Good Robert B. Reich shows how wealth and power have combined to install an oligarchy and undermine democracy. Reich exposes the myths of meritocracy, national competitiveness, corporate social responsibility, the “free market,” and the political “center,” all of which are used by those at the top to divert attention from their takeover of the system and to justify their accumulation of even more wealth and power. In demystifying the current system, Reich reveals where power actually lies and how it is wielded, and invites us to reclaim power and remake the system for all.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hIRYMlt6L._SX335_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
224,The High Cost of Good Intentions: A History of U.S. Federal Entitlement Programs 1st Edition,John F. Cogan,1503610071,978-1503610071,Economics,"Federal entitlement programs are strewn throughout the pages of U.S. history, springing from the noble purpose of assisting people who are destitute through no fault of their own. Yet as federal entitlement programs have grown, so too have their inefficiency and their cost. Neither tax revenues nor revenues generated by the national economy have been able to keep pace with their rising growth, bringing the national debt to a record peacetime level. The High Cost of Good Intentions is the first comprehensive history of these federal entitlement programs. Combining economics, history, political science, and law, John F. Cogan reveals how the creation of entitlements brings forth a steady march of liberalizing forces that cause entitlement programs to expand. This process--as visible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as in the present day--is repeated until benefits are extended to nearly all who could be considered eligible, and in turn establishes a new base for future expansions. His work provides a unifying explanation for the evolutionary path that nearly all federal entitlement programs have followed over the past two hundred years, tracing both their shared past and the financial risks they pose for future generations.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQfHmoqmL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Indeed Lorraine Hansberry's award-winning drama about the hopes and aspirations of a struggling, working-class family living on the South Side of Chicago connected profoundly with the psyche of black America—and changed American theater forever. The play's title comes from a line in Langston Hughes's poem ""Harlem,"" which warns that a dream deferred might ""dry up/like a raisin in the sun.""

""The events of every passing year add resonance to A Raisin in the Sun,"" said The New York Times. ""It is as if history is conspiring to make the play a classic.""

244,The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration,Isabel Wilkerson,679763880,978-0679763888,Politics & Social Science,"One of ""The New York Times Book Review""'s 10 Best Books of the Year
In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.
With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.
Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an ""unrecognized immigration"" within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IBluU1ZiL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

256,Trigonometry Essentials Practice Workbook with Answers: Master Basic Trig Skills: Improve Your Math Fluency Series,Chris McMullen,1477497781,978-1477497784,Mathematics,"WHAT TO EXPECT: This is a workbook designed to offer plenty of practice with essential skills. It is not a textbook designed to teach trigonometry, but a workbook designed to supplement a student's instruction in trigonometry. Examples and a brief description of the concepts are included to serve as a quick refresher and a guide. If you need more instruction, you should use this workbook in combination with a textbook. The last chapter involves applications of trig identities, which is a challenging topic that will mostly interest more advanced students. A few chapters are intended to help students memorize the trig functions of common angles like 30, 150, or 315 degrees, which will be especially useful for students who may take exams without a calculator (that's the case with the MCAT and many math and science courses). There may be more practice than many students need, which is much better than having too little practice. Any extra pages may be helpful for teachers or parents with multiple children.

DESCRIPTION: This Trigonometry Essentials Practice Workbook with Answers provides ample practice for developing fluency in very fundamental trigonometry skills. Every problem can be answered without a calculator, which is very helpful for students who aren't allowed to use a calculator. This is the case in some trig and physics courses, as well as some standardized exams (like the MCAT).

CONTENTS: This workbook is conveniently divided up into 11 chapters so that students can focus on one trigonometry skill at a time. Skills include the following:
converting between degrees and radians;
expressing sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent as fractions by looking at right triangles;
solving for unknown sides and angles in 45°-45°-90° and 30°-60°-90° right triangles;
determining the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent of multiples of 30° and 45° up to 360° (working with both degrees and radians);
practice finding the reference angle for angles in Quadrants II, III, and IV;
finding the inverse trig functions;
applying the law of sines and the law of cosines to solve for unknown sides and angles in acute and obtuse triangles;
solving problems with trig identities (like the angle sum and difference formulas);
and solving algebraic equations that feature basic trig functions.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516yzXwqZQL._SX398_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

This revised version traces the history of money, from ancient gift economies to modern capitalism, and includes new material on cryptocurrencies and emerging research that has come out since the book's original publication. Charles Eisenstein shows how capitalism contributes to alienation, competition, and scarcity; destroys community; and necessitates endless growth at the cost of social and environmental devastation. Today, these trends have reached their extreme--and their collapse presents a golden opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being. Eisenstein describes the deeper narratives beneath our economic system, and how we can reimagine it to align with a new story. Applying a broadly integrated synthesis of theory, policy, and practice, he explores avant-garde concepts of the New Economics, including negative-interest currencies, local economies, gift economics, cryptocurrencies, and the restoration of the commons. Tapping into a rich lineage of conventional and unconventional economic thought, Eisenstein presents a vision that is original yet commonsense, radical yet gentle, and increasingly relevant as the crises of our civilization deepen.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Oi8YFgj1L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

277,Basic Machines and How They Work Revised (1994) Edition,Naval Education And Training Program,486217094,978-0486217093,Engineering,"This revised edition of an extremely clear Navy training manual leaves nothing to be desired in its presentation. Thorough in its coverage of basic theory, from the lever and inclined plane to internal combustion engines and power trains, it requires nothing more than an understanding of the most elementary mathematics. 
Beginning with the simplest of machines — the lever — the text proceeds to discussions of the block and tackle (pulleys and hoists), wheel and axle, the inclined plane and the wedge, the screw, and different types of gears (simple, spur, bevel, herringbone, spiral, worm, etc.). A chapter on the concept of work discusses the measurement of work, friction, and efficiency; this is followed by investigations of power, force, and pressure, with explanations of the uses of scales, balances, gauges, and barometers. The fundamentals of hydrostatic and hydraulic machines (such as the hydraulic braking system and the hydraulic press) are discussed in detail. 
The remaining chapters cover machine elements (bearings and springs), basic mechanisms (gear differential, couplings, cams, clutches), the internal combustion engine and power trains (including explanations of various transmission systems — synchromesh, auxiliary, etc.). 
Every concept is clearly defined, and discussions always build easily from elementary theory to specific applications familiar to anyone with the slightest interest in mechanics. Important concepts, machine components, and techniques are clearly illustrated in more than 200 diagrams, drawings, and cross-sections that reveal inner workings — all of these help to clarify even further an already clear and well-organized presentation. 
Although it was originally designed for use in U.S. Naval Training Schools, this book can be used to great advantage as a basic text in mechanical engineering in standard technical schools, and it will be immensely valuable even to lay readers who desire a basic knowledge of mechanics.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g+YZjv5-L._SX349_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Criminal defense lawyer Lisa Peebles was taken aback by a secretly recorded phone call and police interrogation video that surfaced in a 20-year-old kidnapping case. They held the stench of a cover-up. She recruited an investigative reporter to help unearth the truth and exonerate Gary Thibodeau, the man convicted in the 1994 kidnapping and murder of 18-year-old Heidi Allen.

Scrapped: Justice and a Teen Informant exposes the underbelly of a system built more for finality than justice. It's the true story of Peebles' pursuit of new evidence against three new suspects and her discovery that Heidi had lived a double life: convenience store cashier and undercover informant. The sheriff's office hid the truth after her death as the real killers roamed free. Peebles became a de facto prosecutor to prove their guilt and Gary's innocence. As Heidi's family stood by the sheriff, her remains were likely secreted right under their noses - probably inside a scrapped van and shipped to a car shredder in Canada.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Jj8glcxAL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

In this illuminating book, brain scientist and horsewoman Janet Jones describes human and equine brains working together. Using plain language, she explores the differences and similarities between equine and human ways of negotiating the world. Mental abilities—like seeing, learning, fearing, trusting, and focusing—are discussed from both human and horse perspectives. Throughout, true stories of horses and handlers attempting to understand each other—sometimes successfully, sometimes not—help to illustrate the principles.

Horsemanship of every kind depends on mutual interaction between equine and human brains. When we understand the function of both, we can learn to communicate with horses on their terms instead of ours. By meeting horses halfway, we achieve many goals.

We improve performance.
We save valuable training time.
We develop much deeper bonds with our horses.
We handle them with insight and kindness instead of force or command.

Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qI9quGIdL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

293,Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,Kristin Kobes Du Mez,163149905X,978-1631499050,Politics & Social Science,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER
The “paradigm-influencing” book (Christianity Today) that is fundamentally transforming our understanding of white evangelicalism in America.

Jesus and John Wayne is a sweeping, revisionist history of the last seventy-five years of white evangelicalism, revealing how evangelicals have worked to replace the Jesus of the Gospels with an idol of rugged masculinity and Christian nationalism—or in the words of one modern chaplain, with “a spiritual badass.”

As acclaimed scholar Kristin Du Mez explains, the key to understanding this transformation is to recognize the centrality of popular culture in contemporary American evangelicalism. Many of today’s evangelicals might not be theologically astute, but they know their VeggieTales, they’ve read John Eldredge’s Wild at Heart, and they learned about purity before they learned about sex—and they have a silver ring to prove it. Evangelical books, films, music, clothing, and merchandise shape the beliefs of millions. And evangelical culture is teeming with muscular heroes—mythical warriors and rugged soldiers, men like Oliver North, Ronald Reagan, Mel Gibson, and the Duck Dynasty clan, who assert white masculine power in defense of “Christian America.” Chief among these evangelical legends is John Wayne, an icon of a lost time when men were uncowed by political correctness, unafraid to tell it like it was, and did what needed to be done.

Challenging the commonly held assumption that the “moral majority” backed Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020 for purely pragmatic reasons, Du Mez reveals that Trump in fact represented the fulfillment, rather than the betrayal, of white evangelicals’ most deeply held values: patriarchy, authoritarian rule, aggressive foreign policy, fear of Islam, ambivalence toward #MeToo, and opposition to Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ community. A much-needed reexamination of perhaps the most influential subculture in this country, Jesus and John Wayne shows that, far from adhering to biblical principles, modern white evangelicals have remade their faith, with enduring consequences for all Americans.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41YEXsi0UFL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
294,"Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty","Daron Acemoglu, James A. Robinson",307719227,978-0307719225,Politics & Social Science,"""Brilliant and engagingly written, "" Why Nations Fail ""answers the question that has stumped the experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and others poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food and famine?
""Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are?
Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence?
Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions--with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories.
Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including:
- China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West?
- Are America's best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority?
- What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More
philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson's breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?

Marx and Marxists spoke much of the ""false consciousness"" of people whose arguments are only superficially intellectual, being (though they themselves are unaware of it) mere projections of class prejudice, and who thus believe themselves to be acting from religious or other motives while really driven by economic interests.
Since Marxists took their theory to be the science of society, including history, sociology, and economics, when this became the official view of the state it implied, and in fact resulted in, the substitution of Marxism for the supposed pre-scientific gropings that had hitherto prevailed. In all the Marxist states, alternative views were suppressed, in academe as well as in society as a whole. And this led, as we saw, to a mental enslavement and degeneration of thought.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51oCPkDuVcL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

299,The Foundations of Statistics 2nd Revised ed. Edition,Leonard J. Savage,486623491,978-0486623498,Statistics,"With the 1954 publication of his Foundations of Statistics, in which he proposed a basis that takes into account not only strictly objective and repetitive events, but also vagueness and interpersonal differences, Leonard J. Savage opened the greatest controversy in modern statistical thought. His theory of the foundations, connected with the personalistic interpretation of probability, challenged the then dominant frequentist school. 
In the first seven chapters of his book, Professor Savage is concerned with the foundations at a relatively deep level. To explain and defend his theory of the behavior of a highly idealized person faced with uncertainty, he considers decision making, the sure-thing principle, qualitative and quantitative personal probability, the approach to certainty through experience, symmetric sequences of events, critical comments on personal probability, utility, observations as they affect the decision, and partition problems. In chapters eight through seventeen he discusses statistics proper — the actual devices of the discipline — from the personalistic view. He concentrates on minimax problems and on the theories of estimation and testing. Exercises are included throughout to reinforce and supplement the text. The mathematical techniques used are quite elementary, some calculus and elementary probability theory being presupposed. Understanding of all the material calls for some mathematical maturity on the part of the reader. 
Professor Savage had reevaluated his position somewhat during the decade and a half since the work was first published. While reaffirming the material in the first seven chapters, he had reconsidered the appropriateness of many frequentistic applications. To explain these recent developments, he added a new preface, new footnotes, and a supplementary 180-item, annotated bibliography. Because of Professor Savage's death, the revisions that he made for this edition are his final analysis of the situation.
As he says on page one, ""the foundations are the most controversial parts of many, if not all, sciences."" In statistics, the foundation of probability is ""as controversial a subject as one could name."" In 1954, the controversy was very great, and although it has quieted since, the problem has yet to be resolved. A new generation of readers who have missed Savage's analysis have here an opportunity to study firsthand what his important foundation of statistics — personal probability — is, and what it means to statistical thought.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-6MUDEYLL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

You might be worried that your lack of coding skills or tech industry knowledge will hold you back. But here's the secret: you don't need to learn how to code to break into the tech industry. Written by three former Microsoft PMs, Swipe to Unlock gives you a breakdown of the concepts you need to know to crush your interviews, like software development, big data, and internet security. We'll explain how Google's ad targeting algorithm works, but Google probably won't ask you how to explain it in a non-technical interview. But they might ask you how you could increase ad revenue from a particular market segment. And if you know how Google's ad platform works, you'll be in a far stronger position to come up with good growth strategies. We'll show you how Robinhood, an app that lets you trade stocks without commission, makes money by earning interest on the unspent money that users keep in their accounts. No one will ask you to explain this. But if someone asks you to come up with a new monetization strategy for Venmo (which lets you send and receive money without fees), you could pull out the Robinhood anecdote to propose that Venmo earn interest off the money sitting in users' accounts. We'll talk about some business cases like why Microsoft acquired LinkedIn. Microsoft interviewers probably won't ask you about the motive of the purchase, but they might ask you for ideas to improve Microsoft Outlook. From our case study, you'll learn how the Microsoft and LinkedIn ecosystems could work together, which can help you craft creative, impactful answers. You could propose that Outlook use LinkedIn's social graph to give salespeople insights about clients before meeting them. Or you could suggest linking Outlook's organizational tree to LinkedIn to let HR managers analyze their company's hierarchy and figure out what kind of talent they need to add.

Freedom, Sen argues, is both the end and most efficient means of sustaining economic life and the key to securing the general welfare of the world's entire population. Releasing the idea of individual freedom from association with any particular historical, intellectual, political, or religious tradition, Sen clearly demonstrates its current applicability and possibilities. In the new global economy, where, despite unprecedented increases in overall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary freedoms to vast numbers--perhaps even the majority of people--he concludes, it is still possible to practically and optimistically restain a sense of social accountability.

323,Good Economics for Hard Times,"Abhijit V. Banerjee, Esther Duflo",154178894X,978-1541788947,Economics,"he winners of the Nobel Prize show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of our day.

Figuring out how to deal with today's critical economic problems is perhaps the great challenge of our time. Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.

Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change--these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there--what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.

In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, Good Economics for Hard Times makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.

In this ambitious, provocative book Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo show how traditional western-centric thinking has failed to explain what is happening to people in a newly globalized world: in short Good Economics has been done badly. This precise but accessible book covers many of the most essential issues of our day--including migration, unemployment, growth, free trade, political polarization, and welfare. Banerjee and Duflo will confound and clarify the presumptions of our times, such as:

Why migration doesn't follow the law of supply and demand
Why trade liberalization can drive unemployment up and wages down
Why macroeconomists like to bend the data to fit the model
Why nobody can really explain why and when growth happens
Why economists' assumption that people don't change their minds has made has made polarization worse
Why quite often it doesn't take a village, especially if the villagers aren't that nice

In doing so, they seek to reclaim this essential terrain, and to offer readers an economist's view of the great issues of the day--one that is candid about the complexities, the zones of ignorance, and the areas of genuine disagreement.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kQ6AsbT8L._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

328,Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control,Stuart Russell,‎0525558632,978-0525558637,Engineering,"A leading artificial intelligence researcher lays out a new approach to AI that will enable us to coexist successfully with increasingly intelligent machines In the popular imagination, superhuman artificial intelligence is an approaching tidal wave that threatens not just jobs and human relationships, but civilization itself. Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage. If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41D9qlWTARL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

330,Embedded Systems: Introduction to Robotics,Jonathan W. Valvano,1074544307,978-1074544300,Engineering,"This book is one of four books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to the Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller. An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected together for a common purpose. This book, now in a second printing, teaches the fundamentals of microcontroller interfacing and real-time programming in the context of robotics. There is a chapter on assembly language to expose important concepts of the microcontroller architecture. However, most of the software development occurs in C. This book can be used with Texas Instruments Robot Systems Learning Kit (TI-RSLK). This book provides an introduction to robots that could be used at the college level with little or no prerequisites. Specific topics include microcontrollers, fixed-point numbers, the design of software in C, elementary data structures, programming input/output including interrupts, analog to digital conversion, digital to analog conversion, power, sensor interfacing, motor interfacing, an introduction to digital signal processing, control systems, and communication systems. The book shows how you deploy both Bluetooth Low Energy, and wifi onto the robot, creating an internet of things. The second printing includes a chapter on sensor integration. This book employs a bottom-up approach to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experiences in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Specifically for this volume, look at the lab assignments for TI-RSLK curriculum.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5152vXFbgML._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Wydick,1594601518,978-1594601514,Law,"Last January, the Legal Writing Institute gave Wydick its Golden Pen Award for having written Plain English for Lawyers. The Legal Writing Institute is a non-profit organization that provides a forum for discussion and scholarship about legal writing, analysis, and research. The Institute has over 1,300 members representing all of the ABA-accredited law schools in the United States. Its membership also includes law teachers from other nations, English teachers, and practicing lawyers.The LWI award states: ?Plain English for Lawyers . . . has become a classic. Perhaps no single work has done more to improve the writing of lawyers and law students and to promote the modern trend toward a clear, plain style of legal writing.'In 2003 Wydick retired after 32 years on the law faculty of the University of California, Davis. But he still teaches his favorite course ? a seminar in advanced legal writing for third-year law students. For the past eight summers he has also lectured at the International Legislative Drafting Institute presented in New Orleans by the Public Law Center, a joint venture of Tulane and Loyola law schools. There the audience consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from abroad who earn their living drafting legislation in many different languages. ?Teaching at the Institute,? Wydick says, ?is a precious opportunity to learn how much we English-users have in common with people who write laws in other languages.'How will the fifth edition of Plain English for Lawyers differ from its predecessors? Wydick promises that it will remain a little book, small enough and palatable enough not to intimidate over-loaded law students. ?Most of the text will remain the same,? Wydick says, ?but in the past seven years I've learned some new things about writing in English, and I want to share that with the readers.' In addition, the exercises at the end of the chapters will be different (a welcome change for long-time teachers who are tired of the old ones). Finally, the teacher's manual will include additional exercises that teachers can give to students who want or need extra practice.' . . . probably the most popular legal text today . . . .'?The New York Times","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/412D0N483SL._SX320_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

333,Thinking Like a Lawyer: A New Introduction to Legal Reasoning Reprint Edition,Frederick Schauer,674062485,978-0674062481,Law,"This primer on legal reasoning is aimed at law students and upper-level undergraduates. But it is also an original exposition of basic legal concepts that scholars and lawyers will find stimulating. It covers such topics as rules, precedent, authority, analogical reasoning, the common law, statutory interpretation, legal realism, judicial opinions, legal facts, and burden of proof. In addressing the question whether legal reasoning is distinctive, Frederick Schauer emphasizes the formality and rule-dependence of law. When taking the words of a statute seriously, when following a rule even when it does not produce the best result, when treating the fact of a past decision as a reason for making the same decision again, or when relying on authoritative sources, the law embodies values other than simply that of making the best decision for the particular occasion or dispute. In thus pursuing goals of stability, predictability, and constraint on the idiosyncrasies of individual decision-makers, the law employs forms of reasoning that may not be unique to it but are far more dominant in legal decision-making than elsewhere. Schauer's analysis of what makes legal reasoning special will be a valuable guide for students while also presenting a challenge to a wide range of current academic theories.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q2NYOPZlS._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

This extraordinary document . . . is Applebaum's answer. --Timothy Snyder, author of On Tyranny A Pulitzer Prize-winning historian explains, with electrifying clarity, why elites in democracies around the world are turning toward nationalism and authoritarianism. From the United States and Britain to continental Europe and beyond, liberal democracy is under siege, while authoritarianism is on the rise. In Twilight of Democracy, Anne Applebaum, an award-winning historian of Soviet atrocities who was one of the first American journalists to raise an alarm about antidemocratic trends in the West, explains the lure of nationalism and autocracy.

343,"The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty","Daron Acemoglu, James A. Robinson",735224404,978-0735224407,Politics & Social Science,"From the authors of the international bestseller Why Nations Fail , a crucial new big-picture framework that answers the question of how liberty flourishes in some states but falls to authoritarianism or anarchy in others--and explains how it can continue to thrive despite new threats. In Why Nations Fail , Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argued that countries rise and fall based not on culture, geography, or chance, but on the power of their institutions. In their new book, they build a new theory about liberty and how to achieve it, drawing a wealth of evidence from both current affairs and disparate threads of world history. Liberty is hardly the ""natural"" order of things. In most places and at most times, the strong have dominated the weak and human freedom has been quashed by force or by customs and norms. Either states have been too weak to protect individuals from these threats, or states have been too strong for people to protect themselves from despotism. Liberty emerges only when a delicate and precarious balance is struck between state and society. There is a Western myth that political liberty is a durable construct, arrived at by a process of ""enlightenment."" This static view is a fantasy, the authors argue. In reality, the corridor to liberty is narrow and stays open only via a fundamental and incessant struggle between state and society: The authors look to the American Civil Rights Movement, Europe's early and recent history, the Zapotec civilization circa 500 BCE, and Lagos's efforts to uproot corruption and institute government accountability to illustrate what it takes to get and stay in the corridor. But they also examine Chinese imperial history, colonialism in the Pacific, India's caste system, Saudi Arabia's suffocating cage of norms, and the ""Paper Leviathan"" of many Latin American and African nations to show how countries can drift away from it, and explain the feedback loops that make liberty harder to achieve. Today we are in the midst of a time of wrenching destabilization. We need liberty more than ever, and yet the corridor to liberty is becoming narrower and more treacherous. The danger on the horizon is not ""just"" the loss of our political freedom, however grim that is in itself; it is also the disintegration of the prosperity and safety that critically depend on liberty. The opposite of the corridor of liberty is the road to ruin.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41r8aMr7nGL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

351,Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14 1st Edition,Scott Meyers,1491903996,978-1491903995,Computer Science,"Coming to grips with C++11 and C++14 is more than a matter of familiarizing yourself with the features they introduce (e.g., auto type declarations, move semantics, lambda expressions, and concurrency support). The challenge is learning to use those features effectively --so that your software is correct, efficient, maintainable, and portable. That's where this practical book comes in. It describes how to write truly great software using C++11 and C++14--i.e. using modern C++. Topics include: The pros and cons of braced initialization, noexcept specifications, perfect forwarding, and smart pointer make functions The relationships among std:: move , std:: forward , rvalue references, and universal references Techniques for writing clear, correct, effective lambda expressions How std:: atomic differs from volatile , how each should be used, and how they relate to C++'s concurrency API How best practices in ""old"" C++ programming (i.e., C++98) require revision for software development in modern C++ Effective Modern C++ follows the proven guideline-based, example-driven format of Scott Meyers' earlier books, but covers entirely new material. ""After I learned the C++ basics, I then learned how to use C++ in production code from Meyer's series of Effective C++ books. Effective Modern C++ is the most important how-to book for advice on key guidelines, styles, and idioms to use modern C++ effectively and well. Don't own it yet? Buy this one.

In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through CODE, we see how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries.

Using everyday objects and familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone who's ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines.

It's a cleverly illustrated and eminently comprehensible story--and along the way, you'll discover you've gained a real context for understanding today's world of PCs, digital media, and the Internet. No matter what your level of technical savvy, CODE will charm you--and perhaps even awaken the technophile within.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21R7kFvnskL._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Jo Boaler--Stanford researcher, professor of math education, and expert on math learning--has studied why students don't like math and often fail in math classes. She's followed thousands of students through middle and high schools to study how they learn and to find the most effective ways to unleash the math potential in all students. There is a clear gap between what research has shown to work in teaching math and what happens in schools and at home. This book bridges that gap by turning research findings into practical activities and advice. Boaler translates Carol Dweck's concept of 'mindset' into math teaching and parenting strategies, showing how students can go from self-doubt to strong self-confidence, which is so important to math learning. Boaler reveals the steps that must be taken by schools and parents to improve math education for all. ""Mathematical Mindsets"" Explains how the brain processes mathematics learning Reveals how to turn mistakes and struggles into valuable learning experiences Provides examples of rich mathematical activities to replace rote learning Explains ways to give students a positive math mindset Gives examples of how assessment and grading policies need to change to support real understanding Scores of students hate and fear math, so they end up leaving school without an understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Their evasion and departure hinders math-related pathways and STEM career opportunities. Research has shown very clear methods to change this phenomena, but the information has been confined to research journals--until now.

361,Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know (Random House Large Print),Adam Grant,593395786,978-0593395783,Business,"Think Again is a must-read for anyone who wants to create a culture of learning and exploration, whether at home, at work, or at school... In an increasingly divided world, the lessons in this book are more important than ever. --Bill and Melinda Gates The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take , he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Er2M6NYbL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

From thought leader Dr. Brene Brown, a transformative new vision for the way we lead, love, work, parent, and educate that teaches us the power of vulnerability. """"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.""--""Theodore Roosevelt Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, Dr. Brene Brown dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage. Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, ""and"" the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: ""When we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives."" ""Daring Greatly"" is not about winning or losing. It's about courage. In a world where ""never enough"" dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It's even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there's a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arena--whether it's a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. ""Daring Greatly"" is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511floR8eGL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

It's not as crazy as you might think. In his travels around the world, Simon Sinek, the New York Times bestselling author of Start with Why, noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives were offered, were doomed to in-fighting, fragmentation and failure. Why? The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general when Sinek asked, ""What makes the Marines so good?"" ""Officers eat last,"" the general replied. Sinek saw it firsthand. The most junior Marines ate first, while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders will sacrifice their interests for the good of those in their care. Today's workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoia and self-interest. But the best organizations foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety. When everyone feels they belong, all energies are devoted to facing the common enemy and seizing big opportunities. This is particularly important for our youngest employees. In this revised edition, Sinek further explores the challenge of leading Millennials. As a generation, they want to work somewhere with a sense of purpose-they want to make an impact. But unless their organizations build a Circle of Safety, Millennials will struggle to find what they are looking for. The fascinating research and true stories in this book prove that leaders who are willing to eat last are rewarded with deeply loyal, inspired and effective colleagues.

It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.

In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics.

In a world where economies as diverse as Ireland, Singapore and Dubai have tried to re-create the ""Israel effect,"" there are entrepreneurial lessons well worth noting. As America reboots its own economy and can-do spirit, there's never been a better time to look at this remarkable and resilient nation for some impressive, surprising clues.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515rWDeHmML._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
373,How China Escaped Shock Therapy (Routledge Studies on the Chinese Economy) 1st Edition,Isabella M. Weber,1032008490,978-1032008493,Economics,"China has become deeply integrated into the world economy. Yet, gradual marketization has facilitated the country's rise without leading to its wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism. This book uncovers the fierce contest about economic reforms that shaped China's path. In the first post-Mao decade, China's reformers were sharply divided. They agreed that China had to reform its economic system and move toward more marketization-but struggled over how to go about it. Should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators? With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia's economy collapsed under shock therapy. Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, the book charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization. Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens. Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China's economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41DKAX4M3+S._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

375,How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom,Matt Ridley,62916602,978-0062916600,Economics,"Building on his national bestseller The Rational Optimist, Matt Ridley chronicles the history of innovation, and how we need to change our thinking on the subject.

Innovation is the main event of the modern age, the reason we experience both dramatic improvements in our living standards and unsettling changes in our society. Forget short-term symptoms like Donald Trump and Brexit, it is innovation that will shape the twenty-first century. Yet innovation remains a mysterious process, poorly understood by policy makers and businessmen alike.

Matt Ridley argues that we need to see innovation as an incremental, bottom-up, fortuitous process that happens as a direct result of the human habit of exchange, rather than an orderly, top-down process developing according to a plan. Innovation is crucially different from invention, because it is the turning of inventions into things of practical and affordable use to people. It speeds up in some sectors and slows down in others. It is always a collective, collaborative phenomenon, involving trial and error, not a matter of lonely genius. It happens mainly in just a few parts of the world at any one time. It still cannot be modeled properly by economists, but it can easily be discouraged by politicians. Far from there being too much innovation, we may be on the brink of an innovation famine.

Ridley derives these and other lessons from the lively stories of scores of innovations, how they started and why they succeeded or failed. Some of the innovation stories he tells are about steam engines, jet engines, search engines, airships, coffee, potatoes, vaping, vaccines, cuisine, antibiotics, mosquito nets, turbines, propellers, fertilizer, zero, computers, dogs, farming, fire, genetic engineering, gene editing, container shipping, railways, cars, safety rules, wheeled suitcases, mobile phones, corrugated iron, powered flight, chlorinated water, toilets, vacuum cleaners, shale gas, the telegraph, radio, social media, block chain, the sharing economy, artificial intelligence, fake bomb detectors, phantom games consoles, fraudulent blood tests, hyperloop tubes, herbicides, copyright, and even life itself.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41YgM9k-HkL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

388,Uncertainty in Medicine: A Framework for Tolerance,Paul K.J. Han,190270586,978-0190270582,Medical Science,"Medical uncertainty has been with us for centuries and remains a recurrent problem for patients, doctors, and researchers alike. Yet uncertainty in health care is still poorly understood and ineffectively managed; it is generally feared and avoided rather than directly confronted. This systemic disregard of uncertainty leads us to treat medical uncertainty as a pathological condition to be cured through the pursuit of knowledge, but often further medical knowledge begets further uncertainty in kind.

Uncertainty in Medicine offers an alternative, multi-disciplinary perspective on this challenging problem. Integrating insights across clinical medicine and social science, Dr. Paul Han argues that uncertainty is an essential form of knowledge to be cultivated, rather than eradicated, in medical practice. He makes the case that the paradigm of medicine should be expanded to include not only the pursuit of medical knowledge but the treatment and palliation of medical uncertainty and its effects on physicians, other health professionals, and patients. Using clear language and a textbook approach, he analyzes the nature, etiology, and natural history of medical uncertainty, and develops a conceptual framework to guide its management. By promoting a more systematic way of conceptualizing the problem, this framework can enable clinicians and patients to better address medical uncertainty, and can help make uncertainty tolerance a more central focus of medical care.

Rational and reassuring, Uncertainty in Medicine forges a new path for approaching medical uncertainty by arming readers from an array of disciplines with the tools they need to diagnose, treat, and confront its challenges more intentionally and effectively.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31zTYI2Pt4S._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Trust and Fear in Civil Wars examines the conditions under which individuals are willing to lay down their weapons under a settlement agreement. The author argues that wars are easiest to resolve when combatants believe that their adversaries will uphold a deal or that the costs of renewed war will be low. Several key sources of information inform this calculation. Drawing on both cross-national and case study data, including detailed interviews, the book demonstrates that when information suggests either that a peace agreement is likely to break down or that the results of a broken deal will be especially deadly, a settlement leaves combatants too vulnerable to countenance, resulting in wars lasting longer.

393,Terrorism and the Politics of Naming (ThirdWorlds) 1st Edition,Michael Bhatia,1138873721,978-1138873728,Politics & Social Science,"Previously published as a special issue of Third World Quarterly, this volume assesses the nature, power, role and function of names in global politics and the international media.
Names are not objective, they accrue subjective associations, for example 'Terrorist' has a very different connotation to 'Freedom-fighter'. The contributors seek the truth beneath the names assigned in an effort to remove the obscurity created by the power of 'the politics of naming' to the reality of the situation, taking examples from Al Qaeda, Russia's demonization of the Chechens and naming in the Israeli-Palestine conflict, among other important contemporary debates. Terrorism and the Politics of Naming makes a substantial contribution towards elucidating the power of naming in the discourse of conflict and will be of great interest to students and scholars of political philosophy, political theory, and politics and the media.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31eltxyJouL._SX382_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Have you always wanted to learn how to program but could never afford those ridiculously expensive courses?

Developers and programmers are amongst the highest paid professions in the world, and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs for software and app developers will increase by a shocking 24% in the next few years.

In 2019, the tech industry posted 4.6 million job openings in the US job market, and their direct economic output was estimated at 1.9 trillion dollars.

There's no doubt that the IT industry is the future, and software, web, and app developers are and will be the most coveted professionals for many years to come.

But here's the shock you may not have seen coming: the IT industry has a backdoor--you only need to know how to open it in order to jump straight on that cash wagon.

The key to that door is JavaScript, a programming language that has withstood the test of time and has become one of the most used languages.

You might have heard about some of the companies that use JavaScript: Netflix, Google, Microsoft, eBay, Facebook, Uber, PayPal... The list goes on and on.

Being proficient in JavaScript will basically ensure that you never run out of job options.

As with pursuing any new concept, learning how to program can be intimidating, especially for beginners. Even though JavaScript is incredibly beginner-friendly, it's still complex enough for you to need a guide to lead you through the process of mastering it.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SVTBTm1oL._SX384_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Data is noisy by nature and classical statistical tools have so far been successful in dealing with relatively smaller levels of randomness. The recent emergence of Big Data and the required computing power to analyse them have rendered classical tools outdated and insufficient. Tools such as random matrix theory and the study of large sample covariance matrices can efficiently process these big data sets and help make sense of modern, deep learning algorithms. Presenting an introductory calculus course for random matrices, the book focusses on modern concepts in matrix theory, generalising the standard concept of probabilistic independence to non-commuting random variables. Concretely worked out examples and applications to financial engineering and portfolio construction make this unique book an essential tool for physicists, engineers, data analysts, and economists.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4154WNBwO+S._SX346_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

This volume treats the numerical solution of dense and large-scale eigenvalue problems with an emphasis on algorithms and the theoretical background required to understand them. Stressing depth over breadth, Professor Stewart treats the derivation and implementation of the more important algorithms in detail. The notes and references sections contain pointers to other methods along with historical comments.
The book is divided into two parts: dense eigenproblems and large eigenproblems. The first part gives a full treatment of the widely used QR algorithm, which is then applied to the solution of generalized eigenproblems and the computation of the singular value decomposition. The second part treats Krylov sequence methods such as the Lanczos and Arnoldi algorithms and presents a new treatment of the Jacobi-Davidson method.

The volumes in this survey are not intended to be encyclopedic. By treating carefully selected topics in depth, each volume gives the reader the theoretical and practical background to read the research literature and implement or modify new algorithms. The algorithms treated are illustrated by pseudocode that has been tested in MATLAB implementations.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41m5s36RJSL._SX350_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

There is no better guide than Paul Krugman to basic economics, the ideas that animate much of our public policy. Likewise, there is no stronger foe of zombie economics, the misunderstandings that just won’t die.
In Arguing with Zombies, Krugman tackles many of these misunderstandings, taking stock of where the United States has come from and where it’s headed in a series of concise, digestible chapters. Drawn mainly from his popular New York Times column, they cover a wide range of issues, organized thematically and framed in the context of a wider debate. Explaining the complexities of health care, housing bubbles, tax reform, Social Security, and so much more with unrivaled clarity and precision, Arguing with Zombies is Krugman at the height of his powers.

It is an indispensable guide to two decades’ worth of political and economic discourse in the United States and around the globe, and now includes a preface on ""Zombies in the Age of COVID-19."" With quick, vivid sketches, Krugman turns his readers into intelligent consumers of the daily news and hands them the keys to unlock the concepts behind the greatest economic policy issues of our time. In doing so, he delivers an instant classic that can serve as a reference point for this and future generations.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jw6y2Z9QL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Here, Marx controversially asserts that regardless of the efforts of individual capitalists, public authorities or even generous philanthropists any market economy is inevitably doomed to endure a series of worsening, explosive crises leading finally to complete collapse. But he also offers an inspirational and compelling prediction; that the end of capitalism will culminate in the birth of a far greater form of society.

Revisionist in nature, it reaches the conclusion that monarchy is a lesser evil than democracy, but outlines deficiencies in both. Its methodology is axiomatic-deductive, allowing the writer to derive economic and sociological theorems, and then apply them to interpret historical events.
A compelling chapter on time preference describes the progress of civilization as lowering time preferences as capital structure is built, and explains how the interaction between people can lower time all around, with interesting parallels to the Ricardian Law of Association. By focusing on this transformation, the author is able to interpret many historical phenomena, such as rising levels of crime, degeneration of standards of conduct and morality, and the growth of the mega-state. In underscoring the deficiencies of both monarchy and democracy, the author demonstrates how these systems are both inferior to a natural order based on private-property.

Hoppe deconstructs the classical liberal belief in the possibility of limited government and calls for an alignment of conservatism and libertarianism as natural allies with common goals. He defends the proper role of the production of defense as undertaken by insurance companies on a free market, and describes the emergence of private law among competing insurers. Having established a natural order as superior on utilitarian grounds, the author goes on to assess the prospects for achieving a natural order. Informed by his analysis of the deficiencies of social democracy, and armed with the social theory of legitimation, he forseessecession as the likely future of the US and Europe, resulting in a multitude of region and city-states. This book complements the author's previous work defending the ethics of private property and natural order. Democracy -- The God that Failed will be of interest to scholars and students of history, political economy, and political philosophy.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418AAk4Pi7S._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Not since W. E. B. Du Bois&'s 1907 Economic Co-operation Among Negro Americans has there been a full-length, nationwide study of African American cooperatives. Collective Courage extends that story into the twenty-first century. Many of the players are well known in the history of the African American experience: Du Bois, A. Philip Randolph and the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Jo Baker, George Schuyler and the Young Negroes&' Co-operative League, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panther Party. Adding the cooperative movement to Black history results in a retelling of the African American experience, with an increased understanding of African American collective economic agency and grassroots economic organizing. To tell the story, Gordon Nembhard uses a variety of newspapers, period magazines, and journals; co-ops&' articles of incorporation, minutes from annual meetings, newsletters, budgets, and income statements; and scholarly books, memoirs, and biographies. These sources reveal the achievements and challenges of Black co-ops, collective economic action, and social entrepreneurship. Gordon Nembhard finds that African Americans, as well as other people of color and low-income people, have benefitted greatly from cooperative ownership and democratic economic participation throughout the nation&'s history.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41nTr8gH2uL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Developed in association with the Metal Building Manufacturers Association (MBMA), ""Foundation and Anchor Design for Metal Building Systems"" fills the knowledge void in foundation design and construction by exploring the most common design solutions for pre-engineered building foundations, illustrating their design, and explaining the complex issues involved.

The book describes a variety of possible designs, ranging from the most reliable (and often most expensive) foundation systems to less reliable (and typically less expensive) solutions. It aids structural engineers and contractors in the selection of the most appropriate and cost-effective system for any building. By explicitly recognizing the design differences between the foundations for metal building systems and conventional construction, the book helps owners and contractors develop realistic cost expectations for projects and avoid surprises. Building officials and plan checkers will be able to detect potentially inadequate foundation proposals prepared by those who do not fully grasp the complexities of designing pre-engineered building foundations. Owners and facility managers will understand the risks involved in accepting some lowest-cost foundation solutions that make the building difficult to renovate in the future.

Reviews ""I argued before Judge Aldisert as a young attorney, and I learned from the experience of trying to hold my own in front of the former Marine. I will certainly never forget those occasions.

As law students learn the law and acquire some basic skills, they are also inevitably forming a deep sense of themselves in their new roles as lawyers. That sense of self – the student’s nascent professional identity – needs to take a particular form if the students are to fulfil the public purposes of lawyers and find deep meaning and satisfaction in their work. In this book, Professors Patrick Longan, Daisy Floyd, and Timothy Floyd combine what they have learned in many years of teaching and research concerning the lawyer’s professional identity with lessons derived from legal ethics, moral psychology, and moral philosophy. They describe in depth the six virtues that every lawyer needs as part of his or her professional identity, and they explore both the obstacles to acquiring and deploying those virtues and strategies for overcoming those impediments. The result is a straightforward guide for law students on how to cultivate a professional identity that will allow them to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others and to flourish as individuals.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MrEDmly3L._SX348_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

“Their distinctive contribution to the higher-education debate is to meet safetyism on its own, psychological turf . . . Lukianoff and Haidt tell us that safetyism undermines the freedom of inquiry and speech that are indispensable to universities.” —Jonathan Marks, Commentary

“The remedies the book outlines should be considered on college campuses, among parents of current and future students, and by anyone longing for a more sane society.” —Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Something has been going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising—on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen?

First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures.  Embracing these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—interferes with young people’s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life.

Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction.

This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GIhO0+pUS._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

The Vision of the Anointed is a devastating critique of the mind-set behind the failed social policies of the past thirty years. Thomas Sowell sees what has happened not as a series of isolated mistakes but as a logical consequence of a vision whose defects have led to disasters in education, crime, family disintegration, and other social pathology. In this book, ""politically correct"" theory is repeatedly confronted with facts -- and sharp contradictions between the two are explained in terms of a whole set of self-congratulatory assumptions held by political and intellectual elites. These elites -- the anointed -- often consider themselves ""thinking people,"" but much of what they call thinking turns out, on examination, to be rhetorical assertion, followed by evasions of mounting evidence against those assertions.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41YKzUR-RDL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Without calculus, we wouldn't have cell phones, TV, GPS, or ultrasound. We wouldn't have unraveled DNA or discovered Neptune or figured out how to put 5,000 songs in your pocket. Though many of us were scared away from this essential, engrossing subject in high school and college, Steven Strogatz's brilliantly creative, downtoearth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it's about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number--infinity--to tackle realworld problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous. Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greece and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes ""backwards"" sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn't miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS. As Strogatz proves, calculus is truly the language of the universe.

It begins with an elementary but thorough overview of mathematical logic of first order. The treatment extends beyond a single method of formulating logic to offer instruction in a variety of techniques: model theory (truth tables), Hilbert-type proof theory, and proof theory handled through derived rules.
The second part supplements the previously discussed material and introduces some of the newer ideas and the more profound results of twentieth-century logical research. Subsequent chapters explore the study of formal number theory, with surveys of the famous incompleteness and undecidability results of Godel, Church, Turing, and others. The emphasis in the final chapter reverts to logic, with examinations of Godel's completeness theorem, Gentzen's theorem, Skolem's paradox and nonstandard models of arithmetic, and other theorems.

466,Cloud Computing: A Hands-On Approach 1st Edition,"Arshdeep Bahga, Vijay Madisetti",1494435144,978-1494435141,Networking & Cloud Computing,"About the Book Recent industry surveys expect the cloud computing services market to be in excess of $20 billion and cloud computing jobs to be in excess of 10 million worldwide in 2014 alone. In addition, since a majority of existing information technology (IT) jobs is focused on maintaining legacy in-house systems, the demand for these kinds of jobs is likely to drop rapidly if cloud computing continues to take hold of the industry. However, there are very few educational options available in the area of cloud computing beyond vendor-specific training by cloud providers themselves. Cloud computing courses have not found their way (yet) into mainstream college curricula. This book is written as a textbook on cloud computing for educational programs at colleges. It can also be used by cloud service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of cloud computing to accompany their own customer and employee training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. We have tried to write a comprehensive book that transfers knowledge through an immersive ""hands-on approach"", where the reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for real-world cloud applications. Additional support is available at the book's website: www.cloudcomputingbook.info Organization The book is organized into three main parts. Part I covers technologies that form the foundations of cloud computing. These include topics such as virtualization, load balancing, scalability & elasticity, deployment, and replication. Part II introduces the reader to the design & programming aspects of cloud computing. Case studies on design and implementation of several cloud applications in the areas such as image processing, live streaming and social networks analytics are provided. Part III introduces the reader to specialized aspects of cloud computing including cloud application benchmarking, cloud security, multimedia applications and big data analytics. Case studies in areas such as IT, healthcare, transportation, networking and education are provided.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZQfezrPJL._SX348_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Cloud adoption is a strategy utilized by companies to enhance the scalability of Internet-based data base capabilities while minimizing risk and cost. To accomplish this, businesses implement cloud computing or utilize remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data. Without a centralized strategy for cloud adoption, companies are subject to ""cloud sprawl"", leading to issues with security, compliance and increased costs. CIOs should focus on creating and executing a centralized cloud strategy and utilize it as the foundation for managing the use of cloud services across the business. A poorly implemented cloud strategy can increase cost and reduce agility, thus should involve IT operations and security team during the planning phase. What You'll Learn Leverage cloud computing practices to successfully build a cost-effective cloud environment.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This masterwork is much more than a refutation of the economics of socialism (although on that front, nothing else compares). It is also a critique of the entire intellectual apparatus that accompanies the socialist idea, including the implicit religious doctrines behind Western socialist thinking, a cultural critique of socialist teaching on sex and marriage, a refutation of syndicalism and corporatism, an examination of the implications of radical human inequality, an attack on war socialism, and refutation of collectivist methodology. In short, Mises set out to refute socialism, and instead pulled up the socialist mentality from its very roots. For that reason, Socialism led dozens of famous intellectuals, including a young F.A. Hayek, into a crisis of faith and a realist/libertarian political orientation. All the collectivist literature combined cannot equal the intellectual achievement of this one volume.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41P7SyGw7IL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
472,The Wealth of Nations,"Adam Smith, Edwin Cannan (Editor)",486833895,978-0486833897,Economics,"The Wealth of Nations is considered the seminal work on political economy.

His passionate arguments in favor of free trade, rather than stringent government regulations, posit that individuals are entitled to set and regulate prices for their own goods and services. 
Smith's masterpiece of economic analysis was regarded as revolutionary upon its initial publication, and it continues to exert an active influence on modern politicians and economists. Rich in historical background and acute observations of the eighteenth-century, the book is also an insightful work of political philosophy. Witty and highly readable, it abounds in prescient theories that form the basis of today's capitalist system.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qqjw6LsYL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Houses, health care and higher education have become unaffordable to a majority of people, while the burden of unregulated monopolies, globalization and uncontrolled immigration has fallen disproportionately on the lower and middle classes.

Wrapped in political correctness, an increasingly out of touch Western elite continues catering to special interests and fails to grasp the urgency for change. Populist movements harnessing public anger appear unable to propose and implement effective solutions.

The last financial crisis was bad enough. But the next crisis will spread deeper and wider. And yet we stand economically, politically and most of all intellectually unprepared.

480,Fundamentals of Aerospace Engineering: (Beginner's Guide),"Francisco Gallardo Lopez, Edward G. Gibson (Foreword by), Jens Strahmann",1508587590,978-1508587590,Engineering,"Attention: This book requires no knowledge of math! During my career as an aerospace engineer, I have come to find that math is only one small prerequisite for being successful in the field - what's most important is passion. Aerospace engineering builds on several basic disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, electronics and communications. Even just a rudimentary understanding of these fields enables a more rapid and deep understanding of the advancements in aerospace engineering - whether you be an interested spectator or professional in the field, this is your textbook. Our real limits are far beyond our current perception and we will challenge them for many centuries to come. In aviation, we continuously seek to fly higher and faster - this book's purpose is to give you an idea of the engineering principles which enable powered flights, space exploration and much more. Although humans have envied the flight of birds for many thousands of years, the engineering of powered flight is just over 100 years old, having started with the 12-second, 120-foot flight of the Wright brothers in 1903.Over the years, aerospace progress has demanded the further development of existing technical fields or creation of new ones building on the above basic disciplines. You might be the one to design, engineer and manage the next generation of aircraft, spacecraft, or beyond!

Vaccine marketers teach believers to fear, shame, and scapegoat anyone foolish enough to question the sanctity of vaccines. Such an environment is not the domain of science, rather it's the breeding ground of tyranny. Jabbed exposes this tyranny. From polio and smallpox to medical journals, medical curricula, congressional hearings, regulatory policies, White House statements, and executive orders, Jabbed shines light on the dark underbelly of Big Pharma, Big Medicine, and Big Government. A vaccine informed public is the only thing that will have the power to stop vaccine industry sociopaths and to hold them accountable for their crimes. Jabbed informs and immunises against three of the most dangerous epidemics in history: tyranny, greed, and corruption. Once immunised, the growing vaccine-informed community will have the power to stand up and dismantle the vaccine paradigm and program and to punish the perpetrators of what may well be the greatest medical fraud ever perpetrated on the human race: vaccines.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LJ6kOkS1L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Epidemics of paralysis began to rage in the early 1900s, seemingly out of nowhere. Doctors, parents, and health officials were at a loss to explain why this formerly unheard of disease began paralyzing so many children-usually starting in their legs, sometimes moving up through their abdomen and arms. For an unfortunate few, it could paralyze the muscles that allowed them to breathe.Why did this disease start to become such a horrible problem during the late 1800s? Why did it affect children more often than adults? Why was it originally called teething paralysis by mothers and their doctors? Why were animals so often paralyzed during the early epidemics when it was later discovered most animals could not become infected? The Moth in the Iron Lung is a fascinating biography of this horrible paralytic disease, where it came from, and why it disappeared in the 1950s. If you've never explored the polio story beyond the tales of crippled children and iron lungs, this book will be sure to surprise.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h391UZE+L._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

Figuring that the first step to solving a problem is understanding it, he journeys north into the war zone, interviewing terrorists, generals, and heroin dealers along the way. He discovers an island of beauty and abundance ground down by three decades of war. As he travels north through Colombo, Kandy, and the damaged city of Jaffna, Meadows gives his riveting take on the war. Known for child conscription and drawn-out torture methods, he explains, the Tamil Tigers also invented suicide bombing and were the first to lace together terrorists and financiers into international networks of militant uprising. In Sri Lanka, Meadows discovers a deep view into an ancient culture. Along the way, he learns to trap an elephant, weave rope from coconut husks, and cast out devils, and he actually has tea with a few terrorists. This is the inspiring story of his journey and an enlightening meditation on the interconnectedness of globalization, the media, and modern terrorism.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515XhXLfnKL._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
493,Domination and Resistance (One World Archaeology) 1st Edition,"Daniel Miller, Michael Rowlands, Chris Tilley",415122546,978-0415122542,Politics & Social Science,"The nature of power--one of the central concerns in social science--is the main theme of this wide-ranging book. Introducing a much broader historical and geographical comparative understanding of domination and resistance than is available elsewhere, the editors and contributors offer a wealth of perspectives and case studies, arguing that such studies have reached a key stage. Developments in the characterization of dominance associated with the writings of Marx, Althusser, Foucault and others have been integrated with a recent emphasis on the 'excavation' of hidden, or previously underemphasized, forms of social action which, as 'resistance', are more than just a symptom of oppression. Contributors from many disciplines illustrate the application of these ideas to issues as diverse as ritualized space, the nature of hierarchy in non-capitalist contexts and the production of archaeological discourse. Drawing on considerable experience in promoting interaction between archaeology and other disciplines concerned with ideology, power and social transformation, the editors have brought together a stimulating book that will be of widespread interest amongst students of archaeology, ancient history, sociology, anthropology and human geography. Archaeologists in particular will welcome the innovative coverage of key ideas from the social sciences; for other readers, the book provides a substantial comparative and global context for the development of these ideas.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5130uFoEUZL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
494,"The Separatist Conflict in Sri Lanka: Terrorism, ethnicity, political economy",Asoka Bandarage,1440155615,978-1440155611,Politics & Social Science,"Using careful historical research and analysis of policy documents, this book explains the origin and evolution of the political conflict in Sri Lanka over the struggle to establish a separate state in its Northern and Eastern Provinces. The conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the secessionist LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) is one of the world's most intractable contemporary armed struggles. The internationally banned LTTE is considered the prototype of modern terrorism. It is known to have introduced suicide bombing to the world, and recently became the first terrorist organization ever to acquire an air force. The book argues that the Sri Lankan conflict cannot be adequately understood from the dominant bipolar analysis that sees it as a primordial ethnic conflict between the Sinhala majority and the Tamil minority. The book broadens the discourse providing a multipolar analysis of the complex interplay of political-economic and cultural forces at the local, regional and international levels including the roles of India and the international community. Overall, the book presents a conceptual framework useful for comparative global conflict analysis and resolution, shedding light on a host of complex issues such as terrorism, civil society, diasporas, international intervention and secessionism.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VIwc+9glL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
495,The Politics of Reconstruction and Development in Sri Lanka: Transnational Commitments to Social Change (Routledge/Edinburgh South Asian Studies Series) 1st Edition,Eva Gerharz,081537397X,978-0815373971,Politics & Social Science,"Sri Lanka’s conflict and peace processes have gained global attention during recent years. This book presents a comprehensive insight into the politics of reconstruction and development in Sri Lanka, focussing on the ceasefire which was negotiated between the Government of Sri Lanka and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2002 and which lasted until 2006.
Based on extensive empirical fieldwork, the book provides a unique ethnographic account of this specific historical period of peace. It explains how development was shaped by interplay and cooperation, but also by the disparities and conflicts between a variety of local and intervening actors, including local organizations and civil society, LTTE, Government of Sri Lanka, international development cooperation and the Tamil diaspora. Starting from an interdisciplinary viewpoint, the author integrates findings from development sociology with new perspectives on transnationalization and the migration-development-nexus. This provides a fine grained analysis of the emerging development visions and perspectives in relation to transnationalization and global interconnectedness.

Making an innovative contribution by linking the analysis of local reconstruction with contemporary phenomena of transnationalization, diasporization, and globalization, this book will appeal to those with an interest in Sociology, Social Anthropology and Political Science.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41rd2VOkZwL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

New to the eighth edition: A broader array of basic statistical concepts is covered, especially to better reflect the New Statistics. Journal excerpts have been updated to reflect current styles in statistical reporting. A stronger emphasis on data visualizations has been added. The statistical exercises have been re-organized into units to facilitate ease of use and understanding. About this book Each of the 64 exercises gives a brief excerpt of statistical reporting from a published research article, and begins with guidelines for interpreting the statistics in the excerpt. The questions on the excerpts promote learning by requiring students to interpret information in tables and figures, perform simple calculations to further their interpretations, critique data-reporting techniques, and evaluate procedures used to collect data. Each exercise covers a limited number of statistics, making it easy to coordinate the exercises with lectures and a main textbook. The questions in each exercise are divided into two parts: (1) Factual Questions and (2) Questions for Discussion. The factual questions require careful reading for details, while the discussion questions show that interpreting statistics is more than a mathematical exercise. These questions require students to apply good judgment as well as statistical reasoning in arriving at appropriate interpretations.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZP6j48PpS._SX344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

R is a powerful, flexible, and free tool. However, the flexibility―which eventually becomes a great asset―can make the initial learning curve appear steep. This book introduces a few key aspects of the R tool. As readers become comfortable with these aspects, they develop a foundation from which to more thoroughly explore R and the packages available for it. This introduction does not explain every possible way to analyze data or perform a specific type of analysis. Rather, it focuses on the analyses that are traditionally included in an undergraduate statistics course and provides one or two ways to run these analyses in R. Datasets and scripts to run the examples are provided on an accompanying website. The book has been designed to be an R companion to Warner′s Applied Statistics I, Third Edition, and includes end-of-chapter instructions for replicating the examples from that book in R.
